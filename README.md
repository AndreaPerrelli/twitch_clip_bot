# twitch_clip_bot

Twitch and Discord bot made to automatize clips.
Main commands offered by the bot is the !clip command, which automatically makes a clip, post it on twitch chat and on a discord channel of your choice.
You need to run the script locally, link it to a twitch account of your choice, set up env variables , and invite Ninielbot#4355 to your discord server to get the discord automation as well.
Further updates of this repo will provide possibility to add your channel on a already existing bot instead of running it locally. 
Stay tuned!
